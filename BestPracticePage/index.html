            <h3>"Version control refers to a software engineering framework that tracks all changes and
                synchronizes them with a master file stored on a remote server. An effective version control system is a
                key aspect of writing production code." <a

            </h3>
            <p class="Writing"> The use of Version controls like Github is certainly a practice that programmers and
                software engineers should have,
                simply because it offers a lot of useful features that can easily be adapted, especially by development
                teams that needs
                a repository that they can all access and perform changes on, it also secures the project files from
                accidental alterations
                by providing a way to restore previous changes.
