        <p id="tribute-info">Dr. R.C. Sproul was founder of Ligonier Ministries, founding pastor of <a
                href="https://www.sachapel.com/">Saint Andrew’s Chapel</a> in Sanford,
            Fla.,
            and first president of <a href="https://reformationbiblecollege.org/">Reformation Bible College</a>. He was
            author of more than one hundred books,
            including <a href="https://www.ligonier.org/store/the-holiness-of-god-paperback/"><i>The Holiness of

                Famous Quotes:
            </span>
        </h2>

        <p>
            <q>Nothing could be more irrational than the idea that something comes from nothing.</q>
        </p>
        <p>
            <q>I think the greatest weakness in the church today is that almost no one believes that God invests His
                power in the Bible. Everyone is looking for power in a program, in a methodology, in a technique, in
                anything and everything but that in which God has placed it—His Word. He alone has the power to change
                lives for eternity, and that power is focused on the Scriptures.</q>

        </h2>

        <p>
            R.C. Sproul was a determined Calvinist, who saw himself as an heir of the great reformer John Calvin, and
            others in the reformed tradition such as B.B. Warfield and John Gerstner. He affirmed predestination,
            unconditional election of some and not others to eternal life as the source of salvation, and the idea of a
            limited atonement, that is, that Christ died only for the elect, rather than all people.
