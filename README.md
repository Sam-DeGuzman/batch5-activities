### Avion Projects/Exercises

1. [Best Practices Page](https://sam-deguzman.github.io/batch5-activities/BestPracticePage/index.html) - First activity of the Avion main course, This page gives information about a practice that is considered wise or best being a Software Engineer or Programmer.

1. [Letter Activity](https://sam-deguzman.github.io/batch5-activities/HTML_LetterActivity/index.html) - This page has been a good practice for the original use/purpose of HTML which is to "Mark-up" documents especially in the academic field.

1. [Tribute Page Project](https://sam-deguzman.github.io/batch5-activities/TributePageProject/index.html) - I created a Tribute Page for my Favorite Theologian, Dr. R.C Sproul, also got to practice more of CSS on this one.

1. [Chess Board Flexbox](https://sam-deguzman.github.io/batch5-activities/ChessBoardinFlex/index.html) - This chessboard is done using Flexbox display style.

1. [Chess Board Grid](https://sam-deguzman.github.io/batch5-activities/ChessBoardinGrid/index.html) - I used the same style of the previous chessboard, I've edited images for the chess pieces, and used grid layout for the boxes this time.

1. [Product Landing Page](https://sam-deguzman.github.io/batch5-activities/ProductLandingPage/index.html) - This is one of the final activities for HTML/CSS, I've tried different styles that I've learned so far, and also made sure the user stories are achieved.

1. [JavaScript Calculator](https://sam-deguzman.github.io/batch5-activities/Calculator/index.html) - The first project using JavaScript DOM, this is quite challenging to do because the concept can be confusing. but so far, I believe it works fine. 

1. [BMI Exercise](https://jsfiddle.net/samDg019/sdz8x3w0/7/) - An Exercise for Javascript variables and boolean.

1. [JavaScript Chess Board](https://sam-deguzman.github.io/batch5-activities/ChessBoardJS/index.html) - I think This Project is far too advanced for me currently, So this is mostly from a classmate's work, it uses Grid for the layout same as the previous one and has functions of Moving Pieces, Castling, Taking turn (White First), Timer and En Passant.
