## Welcome to GitHub Pages

[Edit this Page's Markdown](https://github.com/Sam-DeGuzman/batch5-activities/edit/main/README.md)

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

<!---For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).--->

<!---### Jekyll Themes--->
<!---Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Sam-DeGuzman/MainCourse-AvionSchool/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.--->
