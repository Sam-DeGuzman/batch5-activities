1. [Product Landing Page](https://sam-deguzman.github.io/batch5-activities/ProductLandingPage/index.html) - This is one of the final activities for HTML/CSS, I've tried different styles that I've learned so far, and also made sure the user stories are achieved.

1. [JavaScript Calculator](https://sam-deguzman.github.io/batch5-activities/Calculator/index.html) - The first project using JavaScript DOM, this is quite challenging to do because the concept can be confusing. but so far, I believe it works fine.

<!---1. [JavaScript Chess Board](https://sam-deguzman.github.io/batch5-activities/ChessBoardJS/index.html) - I think This Project is far too advanced for me currently, So this is mostly from a classmate's work but I've tried to understand some of the concepts used to add some of my own styles from the grid chessboard, it still uses Grid for the layout same as the previous one and has functions of Moving Pieces, Castling, Taking turn (White First), Timer and En Passant. --->
