## Welcome to Sam's GitHub Page

[Edit this Page's Markdown](https://github.com/Sam-DeGuzman/batch5-activities/edit/main/README.md)

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

<!---For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).--->

<!---### Jekyll Themes--->
<!---Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Sam-DeGuzman/MainCourse-AvionSchool/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.--->
### ChessBoard With JS Submission

1. [JavaScript Chess Board](https://sam-deguzman.github.io/batch5-activities/tree/Chess_BoardJS/index.html) - I think This Project is too advanced for me currently, So this is mostly from a classmate's work but I've tried to understand some of the concepts used to add some of my own styles from the grid chessboard, it still uses Grid for the layout same as the previous one and now has functions of Moving Pieces, Castling, Taking turn (White First), Timer and En Passant.
